Intersted Topic:
I used to produce the quantitative results from paper addressing algorithmic bias in healthcare insurance system. https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ecpe/how-to-prevent-algorithmic-bias-in-health-care/ is an article that provides sensible solutions to such issue.

Data Visualization:
I want to learn how to make the data visualization for the simulation of normal distribution.

Ideas for Investigation:
(1) algorithmic fairness in healthcare industry
(2) protection users' privacy
(3) ethical yet efficient approaches towards data mining process

Ideas From Curated Datasets:
(1) Car Evaluation: this database may be useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation.
(2) Breast Cancer Wisconsin: this database contains parameters pertinent to breast cancer, may be useful to diagnostic prediction https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29.
