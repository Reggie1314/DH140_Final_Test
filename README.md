Topic: Fast Fashion Tweet Analysis

Motivation: I wish to dissect the Twitter discourse surrounding fast fashion to better understand the environmental, social, and cultural issues associated with the industry. Fast fashion is a complicated industry which exploits many aspects of human life. I am specifically interested in how it is entangled with environmentalism, socioeconomic inequality, consumerism, human rights, and fashion culture. My research questions focus on examining how people discuss fast fashion on Twitter through qualitative and quantitative research.

Interested Question:
1. What is the discourse surrounding the advocacy and criticism concerning fast fashion?
2. How do American attitudes towards culture, capitalism, and environmentalism influence attitudes towards practices of fast fashion production and consumption?
